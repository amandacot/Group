We have three different programs. One of them asks your hours, wage, and amount you worked and tells you how much you made. One of them asks for your name, then tells you your name. The last one asks for you birthday and gives you your birthday. 

Download the Code into you computer and open up your terminal. It has three files of code which all do different things. Hi prompts you for your name and when you respond and hit enter, it will print your name. The file bday is similar but promts for your birthday and prints that instead. The file newStuff asks for your hours, wage, and amount of time you workes and gives you how much you've made.
